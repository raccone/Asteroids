# Asteroids
In order to understand how [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) works I created this little copy of Atari's 1979 Asteroids.

## Additions
I thought it would have been nice to add some features and a little bit of *game juice* to the original games, so I end up making a list of thing I would have want to see in my game.
Here's the list.
* screen shaking
* colors flashing
* infinite inertia
* bullet trails
* bullet recoil
* visible healthbar of every object
* particles effects
* touscreen buttons for mobile support
* UFO predicting aiming

## Future improvements
The game is far from finished, since I have to add a lot other small funcionality and correct some bugs and improve performances.
- [ ] more asteroids diversity
- [ ] shattering asteroid
- [ ] following camera
- [ ] main menu
- [ ] grater OS compatibility

## Android port
The Android version is pretty laggy at the moment.
I have to check the internet for tips for making mobile version smoother and correct some errors and faulty logic.
This might mean to rewrite big chunks of code.
I'll see.

## iOS port
This might pretty well fall on the *Future improvements* category, but since I don't have a MacBook of any kind I need to check if this is possible and what will the result be, before buying anything.

#### Notes
This project is a **mess**. It was written with the intention of learn how to use Godot Engine, without any schema or workflow in mind.
Don't be scared
